/**
 * Provides a virtual resource that can be used to change advanced configuration
 * options for a DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL database cluster.
 *
 * > **Note** PostgreSQL configurations are only removed from state when destroyed. The remote configuration is not unset.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as digitalocean from "@pulumi/digitalocean";
 *
 * const exampleDatabaseCluster = new digitalocean.DatabaseCluster("example", {
 *     name: "example-postgresql-cluster",
 *     engine: "pg",
 *     version: "15",
 *     size: digitalocean.DatabaseSlug.DB_1VPCU1GB,
 *     region: digitalocean.Region.NYC1,
 *     nodeCount: 1,
 * });
 * const example = new digitalocean.DatabasePostgresqlConfig("example", {
 *     clusterId: exampleDatabaseCluster.id,
 *     timezone: "UTC",
 *     workMem: 16,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A PostgreSQL database cluster's configuration can be imported using the `id` the parent cluster, e.g.
 *
 * bash
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import digitalocean:index/databasePostgresqlConfig:DatabasePostgresqlConfig example 52556c07-788e-4d41-b8a7-c796432197d1
 * ```
